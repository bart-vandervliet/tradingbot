# üîÅ TradingBot Platform (Open Build)

## Why this exists

Most trading automation platforms are either:
- expensive and locked-in,
- too technical for casual users,
- or closed-source with little transparency.

This project starts from a working prototype of my own bot - currently running on Orca.so using Selenium - 
and evolves into an **open, modular platform** for building, running and analyzing trading strategies ‚Äî  
with full local control.

**I believe in financial independence through systems, not subscriptions.**

## Who it‚Äôs for

This platform is built for:
- DIY traders who want full control
- Financial independence (FI) builders who value autonomy
- Developers who enjoy building their own edge

It‚Äôs open-source by default ‚Äî but designed to support future hosted and managed options  
for those who prefer convenience over configuration.

## What the initial version includes

- ‚úÖ **Smart contracts** and **Exchange APIs**: Work directly with the most popular exchanges, either centralized or decentralized
- ‚úÖ **Strategy builder** (e.g. "If RSI < 30 and volume spikes ‚Üí open position")
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-first**: no private keys or wallets on external servers
- ‚úÖ Built-in **P/L & bookkeeping**
- ‚úÖ **AGPL-3.0 license**

You can run it on your own machine for free ‚Äî  
or optionally subscribe later to hosted versions with frictionless onboarding, analytics and secure app-based execution if you value convenience.
